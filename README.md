A DB using [`BSON`](https://bsonspec.org/) as data storage and writed on [`Python`](https://www.python.org/).

## Pros and Cons
* **`+`** This database is optimized
* **`+`** Built-in database control panel
* **`+`** Full control over database resources
* **`-`** Due to the fact that the database is in python, it can be a little slow (Will be rewritten in `C` in the future)

## TODO List
- [ ] Database control panel
- [ ] Rewrite to `C`
