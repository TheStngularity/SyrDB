If you are going to help me, I will say thank you in advance. Here are written instructions for participation in the development.

# Getting started
First, you need to fork this repository. See [github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) for more information. 

Second, you need to clone the repository. To do, write the following command:

> ```shell
> $ git clone https://github.com/<your username>/SyrDB.git
> ```

If you copied the repository before then get latest code from `main` branch. To do, write the following command:

> ```shell
> $ git pull
> ```

Next, create new branch from `main`, for example `add-ua-language-support-to-webpanel`:

> ```shell
> $ git checkout -b "<name of your branch>"
> ```

Excellent! Now you can change the project code. Done? Then let's continue. Now you need to add all new files. To do, write the following command:

> ```shell
> $ git add .
> ```

Next, you need to commit all changes. To do, write the following command:

> ```shell
> $ git commit -m "<your comment>"
> ```

  
Next, you need to push changes to repository. To do, write the following command:

> ```shell
> $ git push origin "<name of your branch>"
> ```

Next, you need to submit your changes for review, by going to your repository on GitHub and clicking the `Compare & pull request` button. Now submit the pull request by clicking the `Create pull request` button.

Done! Wait while I review the pull request and accept or reject it.
